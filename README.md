  <b>Advanced OSINT tool for cybersecurity investigations with CLI & dashboard support</b>
</p>

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates a real-world **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigation workflow** used by SOC analysts and threat intelligence teams.

It performs:
- Username reconnaissance  
- Email intelligence analysis  
- Breach detection (simulated)  
- Risk scoring & profiling  
- Automated report generation  

---

## ⚡ Features

✔️ Username enumeration across multiple platforms  
✔️ Email metadata analysis (domain, provider, patterns)  
✔️ Simulated breach detection system  
✔️ Risk scoring engine (0–100)  
✔️ CLI interface (hacker-style output)  
✔️ JSON report generation  
✔️ Modular architecture (scalable design)
